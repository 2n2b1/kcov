Kcov (8):
	* Import the man-page from Debian and update it.

	* Simplify parts of the ptrace code

	* Correct the sorting of files-by-percentage when the difference
	  is less than 0.5% (thanks Martin!).

	* Correct the percentage-bar color according to the configured
	  limits in the report.

Kcov (7):
	* Weed out common parts of source paths from the report, display
	  the full path as the HTML title= tag

	* Fix crash bug in argument passing

	* Handle hit count a bit better

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, 2011-07-10

Kcov (6):
	* Correct hit count. The hit count is no longer over the number of
	  possible hits

	* Better error reporting when stripped or otherwise broken binaries
	  are passed to kcov

	* Handle files with relative directory paths (lookup the absolute
	  path via DWARF source files). Otherwise, some files are not reported
	  in the output.

	* Add test program to detect regressions

	* Detect stripped binaries and report that you'll need to build
	  with -g

	* Correct --include/exclude-path behavior. The previous version
	  will match PATH*/* instead of just PATH/* (Igor Murzov)
	  
	* Various small fixes

Kcov (5):
	* Switch from libdwarf to libdw (from elfutils) for building
	  kcov. libdw is a bit more logical than libdwarf.
	  
	* Implement actual path matching (Igor Murzov)

	* Rename path-matching to pattern matching (which is what it does)
	  and set it up using long options.

	* Parse options with getopt

	* Don't escape all multibyte characters in the report. That will
	  break display of UTF-8 etc (Igor Murzov)

	* Improve cmake packaging support (Igor Murzov)

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sat Feb 12 15:25:57 CET 2011

Kcov (4):
	* Build system is now based on cmake (Igor Murzov)

	* Add MIPS32, ARM and PowerPC architecture support. This is untested though
	  and might very well not work at all. 
	  
	* Add -t option to set the title of the program to test (otherwise it
	  will be the filename) 

	* Refactored the architecture support to allow running i386 programs
	  on x86_64 machines, and easier add other architectures

	* Make it possible to collect coverage from multiple programs in a
	  single directory, useful for example when running a test suite

	* Add coverage color to the header as well

	* Misc refactoring

Kcov (3):
	* Various bug fixes

	* Add ability to trace running processes by PID

	* Fix copyright headers

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sat Nov 13 08:13:03 CET 2010

Kcov (2):
	* Misc fixes

	* Add ability to specify low/high limits

	* Add state saving between runs. Re-starting the same program
	  will then add to existing coverage instead of starting from
	  scratch.

	* Link to web page in the report

	* Add option to sort by percentage or file name

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>, Sun Oct 24 09:15:39 CEST 2010

Kcov (1):
	* Initial release

	-- Simon Kagstrom <simon.kagstrom@gmail.com>
